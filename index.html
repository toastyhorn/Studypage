    <section id="introduction">
        <p>In this site, I delve into the immersive world of <i>Overwatch</i> by Blizzard Entertainment, focusing on the synergy between its audio and visual elements.</p>

        <h2>Audio Atmosphere: The Countdown Music</h2>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="timerunningout.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>
        <p>Listen to the tension-building music that plays when the round is almost over in <i>Overwatch</i>. This audio element intensifies the gameplay, creating a sense of urgency and anticipation.</p>
        <p>This use of music can be related to Anzieu's concept of the "sonorous envelope," creating a soundscape at the threshold of the conscious/unconscious, evoking a feeling of being in the womb (Anzieu, "The Sound Envelop").</p>

        <h2>Visual Spectacle: Overwatch Official Trailer</h2>
        <video width="480" height="270" controls>
            <source src="overwatch.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
        <p>Experience the dynamic visuals of <i>Overwatch</i> in its official trailer. The trailer not only showcases the diverse cast of heroes and features of the game but also invites viewers to feel the affect of "being there" within the virtual environment.</p>
        <p>This immersive quality of the video aligns with Barthes' concept of "The affect of being there," emphasizing the player's sense of presence and engagement with the game world (Barthes, "The Reality Effect").</p>

        <h2>Character Portraits: Overwatch Hero Lineup</h2>
        <img src="overwatchlineup.jpg" alt="Overwatch Heroes">
        <p>Explore the diverse cast of heroes in <i>Overwatch</i>, each with a unique visual design contributing to the game's rich narrative.</p>
        <p>The visual diversity and uniqueness of each hero's design resonate with Lindley's concept that we play games to master what we need for survival (Lindley, "A Study of Puzzles").</p>
        <p>In Overwatch, players engage with the hero lineup not only for aesthetic enjoyment but also strategically. Each hero represents a puzzle to be solved, a unique set of abilities to be mastered for successful gameplay. This aligns with Lindley's idea that we play games to master what we need for survival, and in the case of Overwatch, mastering each hero's skills is crucial for effective team play and success in the game.</p>

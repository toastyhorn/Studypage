    <section id="introduction">
        <p>In this project, I will be diving into the universe of the game <i>Overwatch</i> by Blizzard Entertainment. This game has an amazing sound and visual design that immerse you. We will discuss multiple aspects of the game and relate it to our readings in this class.</p>

        <h2>Audio Atmosphere: The Countdown Music</h2>

        </audio>
        <p>Let's listen to the music that is entitled "Time's Running Out." This music plays when the round is almost over and intensifies the gameplay immensely. It gives the player a sense of urgency and anticipation. </p>
        <p>The use of this music shows Anzieu's concept of the "sonorous envelope." This creates a soundscape at the threshold of the consious/unconsious, and it evokes a feeling of being in the womb.</p>

        <h2>Visual Spectacle: Overwatch Official Trailer</h2>

        <p>Up next we will experience the first opening cutscene in the game <i>Overwatch</i>, which was also the trailer for the game. This trailer showcases the different heroes and features of the game and makes the viewer feel like they're there with it's immersive qualities. </p>
        <p>These immersive qualities of the Overwatch trailer can be tied to Barthes' concept of "The affect of being there," it gives the player a sense of being present in the game world.</p>

        <h2>Character Portraits: Overwatch Hero Lineup</h2>

        <p>Lastly, we will analyze the diverse cast of heroes in <i>Overwatch.</i> These heroes each have a very unique visual design which makes the game even more meaning. Each character's visual design represents a story unique to each and every character. </p>
        <p>The character's visual design is aligned with Lindley's concept,  which is that we play games to master what we need for survival. In the game, players pick the heroes not just based on their visual look, but also strategically as a pick in the game. </p>
        <p>Each hero is like a puzzle that needs to be solved, with unique abilities and powers to be learned and mastered by the player. The idea that we play games to master what we need for survival is true in the case of <i>Overwatch</i>, where we master each hero's abilities to win the game as a team.</p>
